Problem Statement
We have to create nodes using the graph database neo4j and show the relationship between various nodes.
Abstract:
The Neo4j graph database management system was used in this project to represent and analyse a complex network of data, and the results are presented in this report. Large datasets must be imported into Neo4j for the project in order to build a graph database that shows the connections between the data's elements. To gain useful insights from the data, the Cypher query language was used to query the graph database. The report gives a broad overview of the project's goals, approach, and outcomes. It emphasizes the advantages of modelling and analysing complicated networks of data using a graph database like Neo4j. The report offers suggestions for future work as well as a discussion of some of the difficulties encountered during the project.
Introduction:
This Neo4j project provides a powerful and flexible solution for analysing complex relationships in the entertainment industry. It offers a new and innovative way to manage and analyse large and complex networks of data, which can provide valuable insights for actors, directors, producers, and other stakeholders in the industry.
In the entertainment industry, movies generate a vast amount of data, with thousands of actors being nominated for various roles each year. This data is often dispersed across multiple sources, making it difficult to manage and analyse effectively. Additionally, the relationships between actors, movies, and awards are often complex and interconnected, which further complicates the analysis.
The Neo4j project that we have undertaken aims to model and analyse the relationships between actors who have acted in movies and have been nominated for a certain role. This project utilizes the power and flexibility of Neo4j, a graph database management system, to represent these relationships as nodes and edges.

Project Introduction:
We are making a project on the academy awards for the actors, directors who are nominated for a particular role. We have formed a relationship between the same.
We have used graph database neo4j for this purpose because it gives us clarity about the relationship and nodes.
We have used cypher to make our codes and for the coding language we are using cql. Cypher is a declarative query language used to interact with the Neo4j graph database management system. It is designed to be expressive, readable, and easy to learn, with a syntax that is like SQL and other database query languages. In Cypher, queries are expressed using ASCII art-style patterns that represent the nodes and relationships in the graph.
CQL, on the other hand, stands for Cassandra Query Language, which is a query language used to interact with the Apache Cassandra NoSQL database. CQL is a SQL-like language with a similar syntax to SQL, but it is designed specifically for Cassandra's data model.
While both Cypher and CQL are query languages used in different types of databases, they have distinct syntaxes and are designed for different data models. Cypher is used specifically for Neo4j's graph data model, while CQL is used for Cassandra's column-family data model.
